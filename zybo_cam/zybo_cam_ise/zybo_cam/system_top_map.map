WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <CAMERA_PCLK> is placed at site <V17>. The corresponding
   BUFGCTRL component <CAMERA_PCLK_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site
   <BUFGCTRL_X0Y22>. The clock IO can use the fast path between the IOB and the
   Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that has
   dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in its half of the device (TOP or
   BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it. This
   is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <CAMERA_PCLK.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
